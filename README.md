This repository is strictly based on the official [**Rust Book**](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/), which remains the best resource for learning the Rust programming language.
The goal here is simple, make Rust easier to understand without losing any of its depth or accuracy.

If you‚Äôre extremely new to Rust(this repository will be enough though), I recommend watching any of these two YouTube playlists:

* [Let‚Äôs Get Rusty ‚Äî Complete Rust Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLai5B987bZ9CoVR-QEIN9foz4QCJ0H2Y8)
* [Brooks Builds ‚Äî Rust for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAJ-sYO1aGdxQ_skPPtJ7PlSAjTXM-atv)
